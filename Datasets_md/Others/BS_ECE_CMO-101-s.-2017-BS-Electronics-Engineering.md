## Section 12. Sample Curriculum Map

Curriculum map is "a matrix   relating all the courses   listed in the program curriculum with one or more of the declared studentlprogram

<!-- image -->

The HEIILUCISUC may develop their own Curriculum (Refer to Annex for the Minimum Program Outcomes and a Sample Curriculum Map. Map.

## Section 13.Description of Outcomes-Based Teaching and Learning

Outcomes-based teaching and learning (OBTL) is an approach where teaching and learning activities are developed to support the learning outcomes (University of Hong Kong; 2007). It is a student-centered approach for the delivery of educational programs where the curriculum topics in a program and the courses contained in it are expressed as the intended outcomes for students to learn. It is an approach in which teachers facilitate and students find themselves actively engaged in their learning. The four power principles of OBE are (1) clarity of focus (2) Expanded Opportunity (3) High Expectation and (4) Design Down.

Its primary focus is the clear statement of what students should be able t0 do after taking course; known as the Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs) The ILOs describe what the learners will be able to do when have completed their course or program. These are statements, written from the students' perspective; indicating the level of understanding and performance are expected to achieve as a result of engaging in teaching and learning experience (Biggs and Tang, 2007). Once the ILOs have been determined, the next step in OBTL is to design the Teaching Learning Activities (TLAs) which require students to actively participate in the construction of their new knowledge and abilities. A TLA is any  activity which stimulates , encourages or facilitates learning of one or more intended learning outcome\_ The final OBTL component is the Assessment Tasks (ATs) which measure how well students can use their new abilities to solve real-world problems, design; demonstrate creativity , and communicate effectively, among others\_ An AT can be any method of assessing how well a set of ILO has been achieved. they they component of a course design using OBTL is the constructive alignment of ILOs, TLAs, and ATs. This design methodology requires the Intended Learning Outcomes to be developed first, and then the Teaching Learning Activities and Assessment Tasks are developed key

"Constructive"   refers to the idea that  students construct  meaning through relevant learning activities; "alignment" refers to the situation when teaching and learning activities, and assessment tasks; are aligned to the Intended   Learning Outcomes by using the verbs

stipulated in the ILOs. Constructive alignment provides the "how-to" by stating that the TLAs and the assessment tasks activate the same verbs as in the ILOs (Biggs and Tang, 1999).

The OBTL approach shall be reflected in the Course Syllabus to be implemented by the faculty .

## Section 14. Curriculum Delivery

All HEls are expected to create their Curriculum Delivery Plan. The purpose of the plan is to give clear   guidance on the school's curriculum; and to give a statement of expectations that will form the basis for reviewing quality and effectiveness.

## Section 15. Course Syllabus and Course Specifications:

The Course Syllabus must contain at least the following components:

- 15.1. General Course Information (Title, Description, Code; Credit Units , Prerequisites)

| Course Description                         | The course introduces the concept of integration and its application to some physical problems such as evaluation of areas, volumes of revolution; force; and work. The fundarental formulas and various techniques of integration are taken up and applied to both single variable and multi-variable functions . The course also includes tracing of functions of two variables for a better appreciation of the interpretation of the double and triple integral as volume of a three-dimensional region bounded by two or more surfaces. |

| Course Description                         | This course is designed for undergraduate engineering students with emphasis on problem solving related to societal issues that engineers and scientists are called upon to solve. It introduces different methods of data collection and the suitability of using a particular method for a given situation: The  relationship statistics is also discussed , providing students with the tools need to understand how "chance" plays a role in statistical   analysis. Probability  distributions of random variables and their uses are also considered, along with a discussion of linear functions of random variables within the context of their application to data analysis and inference. The course also includes estimation   techniques for unknown parameters; and hypothesis testing used in making inferences from sample to population; inference for regression parameters and build models for estimating means and predicting future values of key variables under study. Finally,  statistically based experimental design techniques and analysis of outcomes of experiments are discussed with the aid of statistical software. they |

| Course Description                         | The topics are primarily based on CPU and memory management starting from the hardware architecture before moving to process scheduling and resource allocation. Here only central   memory allocation is considered [because the disk allocation has been considered in the first part of the course. Some general properties of process synchronization are investigated dealing] with the classical problem of critical regions; producer-consumer relationship| and the more_general framework_of the client-server_schema |
