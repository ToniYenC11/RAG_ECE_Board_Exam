    "- **What CI/CD adds**: Automated project setup, environment provisioning\n",
    "- **Benefit**: New features can be planned with deployment automation in mind\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Development Phase**\n",
    "- **What CI/CD adds**:\n",
    "    - Code is automatically tested on every commit\n",
    "    - Immediate feedback on code quality\n",
    "    - Automated code reviews and linting\n",
    "- **Benefit**: Developers catch bugs within minutes, not day\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Testing Phase**\n",
    "- **What CI/CD adds**:\n",
    "    - Automated unit tests, integration tests, UI tests\n",
    "    - Parallel testing across multiple environments\n",
    "    - Automated security scanning\n",
    "- **Benefits**: Testing happens continuously, not just at the end\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Integration Phase**\n",
    "- **What CI/CD adds**:\n",
    "    - Code automatically merges if tests pass\n",
    "    - Immediate conflict detection\n",
    "    - Automated dependency updates\n",
    "- **Benefit**: No more \"integration hell\" - small, frequent integrations\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Deployment Phase**\n",
    "- **What CI/CD adds**:\n",
    "    - Automated deployment to staging/production\n",
    "    - Zero-downtime deployments\n",
    "    - Automatic rollback if issues detected\n",
    "- **Benefit**: Deployments happen multiple times per day safely\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Monitoring Phase**\n",
    "- **What CI/CD adds**:\n",
    "    - Automated monitoring and alerting\n",
    "    - Performance tracking after each deployment\n",
    "    - Automatic scaling based on usage\n",
